# Defi Chat 
[start using Defi Chat!](https://defichat.vercel.app/)

This is a *decentralized*, *peer to peer*, *chatting application*, that is using IPFS via [***GunDB***](https://gun.eco/) for it's database and it is powered by [***Moralis.io***](https://moralis.io/)!

The frontend of this web application is built using ***React JS*** and the backend is built using ***Node***. 

User can Login(or Sign Up) using their [***MetaMask wallet***](https://metamask.io/) and for implementing Metamask Login compatibility in my application, I have used [***Moralis.io***](https://moralis.io/).

You can chat with your friends freely, without worrying that someone might be spying on your personal messages, as this is a peer-to-peer communication!!

You can add your friends using their Ethereum Address once they are registered on the app !
